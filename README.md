# effectFilterApp
An app to apply some filter of EffectFactory in photos

To apply the filters in the pictures I use [**EffectFactory**](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/effect/EffectFactory.html)

It has a fragment called CameraFragment, but it is not being used, because I decided to use the native camera. I didn't remove because I liked the way the fragment was implemented and I pretend to use in some near future.
